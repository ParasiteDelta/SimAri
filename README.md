### A basic math problem generator.
##### Mainly just an experiment with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui).

This thing just generates elementary math problems using a simple GUI instead of the command line. I was wondering just how easy it could be to write a GUI using the [egui library](https://github.com/emilk/egui), and while tedious or frustrating at points, it's probably the simplest GUI library that actually gets you closer to native compared to other popular options.

50/50 on whether or not I will revisit this.
